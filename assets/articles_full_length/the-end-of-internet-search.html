                                        <p>We all know what it means, colloquially, to google something. You pop a few
                                            relevant words in a search box and in return get a list of blue links to the
                                            most relevant results. Maybe some quick explanations up top. Maybe some maps
                                            or sports scores or a video. But fundamentally, it’s just fetching
                                            information that’s already out there on the internet and showing it to you,
                                            in some sort of structured way. </p>
                                        <p>But all that is up for grabs. We are at a new inflection point.</p>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                        <p>The biggest change to the way search engines have delivered information to us
                                            since the 1990s is happening right now. No more keyword searching. No more
                                            sorting through links to click. Instead, we’re entering an era of
                                            conversational search. Which means instead of keywords, you use real
                                            questions, expressed in natural language. And instead of links, you’ll
                                            increasingly be met with answers, written by generative AI and based on live
                                            information from all across the internet, delivered the same way. </p>
                                        <p>Of course, Google—the company that has defined search for the past 25
                                            years—is trying to be out front on this. In May of 2023, it began testing
                                            AI-generated responses to search queries, using its large language model
                                            (LLM) to deliver the kinds of answers you might expect from an expert source
                                            or trusted friend. It calls these AI Overviews. Google CEO Sundar Pichai
                                            described this to <em>MIT Technology Review</em> as “one of the most
                                            positive changes we’ve done to search in a long, long time.”</p>
                                        <div id="piano__post_body-desktop-1" class="piano__post_body"></div>
                                        <p>AI Overviews fundamentally change the kinds of queries Google can address.
                                            You can now ask it things like “I’m going to Japan for one week next month.
                                            I’ll be staying in Tokyo but would like to take some day trips. Are there
                                            any festivals happening nearby? How will the surfing be in Kamakura? Are
                                            there any good bands playing?” And you’ll get an answer—not just a link to
                                            Reddit, but a built-out answer with current results. </p>
                                        <p>More to the point, you can attempt searches that were once pretty much
                                            impossible, and get the right answer. You don’t have to be able to
                                            articulate what, precisely, you are looking for. You can describe what the
                                            bird in your yard looks like, or what the issue seems to be with your
                                            refrigerator, or that weird noise your car is making, and get an almost
                                            human explanation put together from sources previously siloed across the
                                            internet. It’s amazing, and once you start searching that way, it’s
                                            addictive.</p>
                                        <div id="piano__post_body-mobile-1" class="piano__post_body"></div>
                                        <p>And it’s not just Google. OpenAI’s ChatGPT now has access to the web, making
                                            it far better at finding up-to-date answers to your queries. Microsoft
                                            released generative search results for Bing in September. Meta has its own
                                            version. The startup Perplexity was doing the same, but with a “move fast,
                                            break things” ethos. Literal trillions of dollars are at stake in the
                                            outcome as these players jockey to become the next go-to source for
                                            information retrieval—the next Google.</p>

                                        <p>Not everyone is excited for the change. Publishers are completely freaked
                                            out. The shift has heightened fears of a “zero-click” future, where search
                                            referral traffic—a mainstay of the web since before Google existed—vanishes
                                            from the scene. </p>
                                        <p>I got a vision of that future last June, when I got a push alert from the
                                            Perplexity app on my phone. Perplexity is a startup trying to reinvent web
                                            search. But in addition to delivering deep answers to queries, it will
                                            create entire articles about the news of the day, cobbled together by AI
                                            from different sources. </p>
                                        <p>On that day, it pushed me a story about a new drone company from Eric
                                            Schmidt. I recognized the story. <em>Forbes</em> had reported it
                                            exclusively, earlier in the week, but it had been locked behind a paywall.
                                            The image on Perplexity’s story looked identical to one from
                                            <em>Forbes</em>. The language and structure were quite similar. It was
                                            effectively the same story, but freely available to anyone on the internet.
                                            I texted a friend who had edited the original story to ask if
                                            <em>Forbes</em> had a deal with the startup to republish its content. But
                                            there was no deal. He was shocked and furious and, well, perplexed. He
                                            wasn’t alone. <em>Forbes</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, and Condé Nast
                                            have now all sent the company cease-and-desist orders. News Corp is suing
                                            for damages.

                                        <p>It was precisely the nightmare scenario publishers have been so afraid of:
                                            The AI was hoovering up their premium content, repackaging it, and promoting
                                            it to its audience in a way that didn’t really leave any reason to click
                                            through to the original. In fact, on Perplexity’s About page, the first
                                            reason it lists to choose the search engine is “Skip the links.”</p>
                                        <p>But this isn’t just about publishers (or my own self-interest). </p>
                                        <p>People are also worried about what these new LLM-powered results will mean
                                            for our fundamental shared reality. Language models have a tendency to make
                                            stuff up—they can hallucinate nonsense. Moreover, generative AI can serve up
                                            an entirely new answer to the same question every time, or provide different
                                            answers to different people on the basis of what it knows about them. It
                                            could spell the end of the canonical answer.</p>
                                        <p>But make no mistake: This is the future of search. Try it for a bit yourself,
                                            and you’ll see. </p>

                                        <p>Sure, we will always want to use search engines to navigate the web and to
                                            discover new and interesting sources of information. But the links out are
                                            taking a back seat. The way AI can put together a well-reasoned answer to
                                            just about any kind of question, drawing on real-time data from across the
                                            web, just offers a better experience. That is especially true compared with
                                            what web search has become in recent years. If it’s not exactly broken (data
                                            shows more people are searching with Google more often than ever before),
                                            it’s at the very least increasingly cluttered and daunting to navigate. </p>
                                        <p>Who wants to have to speak the language of search engines to find what you
                                            need? Who wants to navigate links when you can have straight answers? And
                                            maybe: Who wants to have to learn when you can just know? </p>

                                        <p>In the beginning there was Archie. It was the first real internet search
                                            engine, and it crawled files previously hidden in the darkness of remote
                                            servers. It didn’t tell you what was in those files—just their names. It
                                            didn’t preview images; it didn’t have a hierarchy of results, or even much
                                            of an interface. But it was a start. And it was pretty good. </p>
                                        <p>Then Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web, and all manner of web pages
                                            sprang forth. The Mosaic home page and the Internet Movie Database and
                                            Geocities and the Hampster Dance and web rings and <em>Salon</em> and eBay
                                            and CNN and federal government sites and some guy’s home page in Turkey.</p>

                                            websites. It quickly became the home page for millions of people. And it was
                                            … well, it was okay. TBH, and with the benefit of hindsight, I think we all
                                            thought it was much better back then than it actually was.</p>
                                        <p>But the web continued to grow and sprawl and expand, every day bringing more
                                            information online. Rather than just a list of sites by category, we needed
                                            something that actually looked at all that content and indexed it. By the
                                            late ’90s that meant choosing from a variety of search engines: AltaVista
                                            and AlltheWeb and WebCrawler and HotBot. And they were good—a huge
                                            improvement. At least at first. </p>
                                        <p>But alongside the rise of search engines came the first attempts to exploit
                                            their ability to deliver traffic. Precious, valuable traffic, which web

                                            designed purely to push pages higher up in search results. It got pretty

                                        <p>And then came Google. It’s hard to overstate how revolutionary Google was
                                            when it launched in 1998. Rather than just scanning the content, it also
                                            looked at the sources linking to a website, which helped evaluate its
                                            relevance. To oversimplify: The more something was cited elsewhere, the more
                                            reliable Google considered it, and the higher it would appear in results.
                                            This breakthrough made Google radically better at retrieving relevant
                                            results than anything that had come before. It was <em>amazing</em>. </p>

                                            people. (The extent of that domination is currently the subject of multiple
                                            legal probes in the United States and the European Union.) </p>

                                        <p>It’s true: Google has evolved over time, becoming more and more of an answer
                                            portal. It has added tools that allow people to just get an answer—the live
                                            score to a game, the hours a café is open, or a snippet from the FDA’s
                                            website—rather than being pointed to a website where the answer may be. </p>
                                        <p>But once you’ve used AI Overviews a bit, you realize they are
                                            <em>different</em>.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Take featured snippets, the passages Google sometimes chooses to highlight
                                            and show atop the results themselves. Those words are quoted directly from
                                            an original source. The same is true of knowledge panels, which are
                                            generated from information stored in a range of public databases and
                                            Google’s Knowledge Graph, its database of trillions of facts about the
                                            world.</p>
                                        <p>While these can be inaccurate, the information source is knowable (and
                                            fixable). It’s in a database. You can look it up. Not anymore: AI Overviews
                                            can be entirely new every time, generated on the fly by a language model’s
                                            predictive text combined with an index of the web. </p>

                                        <p>“I think it’s an exciting moment where we have obviously indexed the world.
                                            We built deep understanding on top of it with Knowledge Graph. We’ve been
                                            using LLMs and generative AI to improve our understanding of all that,”
                                            Pichai told <em>MIT Technology Review</em>. “But now we are able to generate
                                            and <em>compose</em> with that.”</p>
                                        <p>The result feels less like a querying a database than like asking a very
                                            smart, well-read friend. (With the caveat that the friend will sometimes
                                            make things up if she does not know the answer.) </p>
                                        <p>“[The company’s] mission is organizing the world’s information,” Liz Reid,
                                            Google’s head of search, tells me from its headquarters in Mountain View,
                                            California. “But actually, for a while what we did was organize web pages.
                                            Which is not really the same thing as organizing the world’s information or
                                            making it truly useful and accessible to you.” </p>
                                        <p>That second concept—accessibility—is what Google is really keying in on with
                                            AI Overviews. It’s a sentiment I hear echoed repeatedly while talking to
                                            Google execs: They can address more complicated types of queries more
                                            efficiently by bringing in a language model to help supply the answers. And
                                            they can do it in natural language. </p>

                                        <p>That will become even more important for a future where search goes beyond
                                            text queries. For example, Google Lens, which lets people take a picture or
                                            upload an image to find out more about something, uses AI-generated answers
                                            to tell you what you may be looking at. Google has even showed off the

                                        <p>There are some real hazards here. First and foremost: Large language models
                                            will lie to you. They hallucinate. They get shit wrong. When it doesn’t have
                                            an answer, an AI model can blithely and confidently spew back a response
                                            anyway. For Google, which has built its reputation over the past 20 years on
                                            reliability, this could be a real problem. For the rest of us, it could
                                            actually be dangerous.</p>
                                        <p>In May 2024, AI Overviews were rolled out to everyone in the US. Things
                                            didn’t go well. Google, long the world’s reference desk, told people to eat
                                            rocks and to put glue on their pizza. These answers were mostly in response
                                            to what the company calls adversarial queries—those designed to trip it up.
                                            But still. It didn’t look good. The company quickly went to work fixing the
                                            problems—for example, by deprecating so-called user-generated content from
                                            sites like Reddit, where some of the weirder answers had come from.</p>
                                        <p>Yet while its errors telling people to eat rocks got all the attention, the
                                            more pernicious danger might arise when it gets something less obviously
                                            wrong. For example, in doing research for this article, I asked Google when
                                            <em>MIT Technology Review</em> went online. It helpfully responded that
                                            “<em>MIT Technology Review</em> launched its online presence in late 2022.”
                                            This was clearly wrong to me, but for someone completely unfamiliar with the
                                            publication, would the error leap out?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>I came across several examples like this, both in Google and in OpenAI’s
                                            ChatGPT search. Stuff that’s just far enough off the mark not to be
                                            immediately seen as wrong. Google is banking that it can continue to improve
                                            these results over time by relying on what it knows about quality sources.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>“When we produce AI Overviews,” says Nayak, “we look for corroborating
                                            information from the search results, and the search results themselves are
                                            designed to be from these reliable sources whenever possible. These are some
                                            of the mechanisms we have in place that assure that if you just consume the
                                            AI Overview, and you don’t want to look further … we hope that you will
                                            still get a reliable, trustworthy answer.”</p>
                                        <p>In the case above, the 2022 answer seemingly came from a reliable source—a
                                            story about <em>MIT Technology Review</em>’s email newsletters, which
                                            launched in 2022. But the machine fundamentally misunderstood. This is one
                                            of the reasons Google uses human beings—raters—to evaluate the results it
                                            delivers for accuracy. Ratings don’t correct or control individual AI
                                            Overviews; rather, they help train the model to build better answers. But
                                            human raters can be fallible. Google is working on that too. </p>

                                            ability to maintain accuracy even with the LLM generating responses. That’s
                                            because AI Overviews is based on Google’s flagship large language model,
                                            Gemini, but also draws from Knowledge Graph and what it considers reputable
                                            sources around the web. </p>
                                        <p>“You’re always dealing in percentages. What we have done is deliver it at,
                                            like, what I would call a few nines of trust and factuality and quality. I’d
                                            say 99-point-few-nines. I think that’s the bar we operate at, and it is true
                                            with AI Overviews too,” he says. “And so the question is, are we able to do
                                            this again at scale? And I think we are.”</p>
                                        <p>There’s another hazard as well, though, which is that people ask Google
                                            <em>all sorts of weird things</em>. If you want to know someone’s darkest
                                            secrets, look at their search history. Sometimes the things people ask
                                            Google about are extremely dark. Sometimes they are illegal. Google doesn’t
                                            just have to be able to deploy its AI Overviews when an answer can be
                                            helpful; it has to be extremely careful not to deploy them when an answer
                                            may be harmful.

                                        <p>“If you go and say ‘How do I build a bomb?’ it’s fine that there are web
                                            results. It’s the open web. You can access anything,” Reid says. “But we do
                                            not need to have an AI Overview that tells you how to build a bomb, right?

                                            of a Google search. Take publishers, who for decades now have relied on
                                            search queries to send people their way. What reason will people have to

                                            right there in the search result? </p>

                                                proportion of searches that end without a click has gone up and up</a>.
                                            His sense is that AI Overviews are going to explode this trend. </p>

                                        <p><em>Don’t panic</em>, is Pichai’s message. He argues that even in the age of
                                            AI Overviews, people will still want to click through and go deeper for many
                                            types of searches. “The underlying principle is people are coming looking
                                            for information. They’re not looking for Google always to just answer,” he
                                            says. “Sometimes yes, but the vast majority of the times, you’re looking at
                                            it as a jumping-off point.” </p>
                                        <p>Reid, meanwhile, argues that because AI Overviews allow people to ask more
                                            complicated questions and drill down further into what they want, they could
                                            even be helpful to some types of publishers and small businesses, especially
                                            those operating in the niches: “You essentially reach new audiences, because
                                            people can now express what they want more specifically, and so somebody who
                                            specializes doesn’t have to rank for the generic query.”</p>

                                        <p><sup> “</sup>I’m going to start with something risky,” Nick Turley tells me
                                            from the confines of a Zoom window. Turley is the head of product for
                                            ChatGPT, and he’s showing off OpenAI’s new web search tool a few weeks
                                            before it launches. “I should normally try this beforehand, but I’m just
                                            gonna search for you,” he says. “This is always a high-risk demo to do,
                                            because people tend to be particular about what is said about them on the
                                            internet.” </p>
                                        <p>He types my name into a search field, and the prototype search engine spits
                                            back a few sentences, almost like a speaker bio. It correctly identifies me
                                            and my current role. It even highlights a particular story I wrote years ago
                                            that was probably my best known. In short, it’s the right answer. Phew? </p>
                                        <p>A few weeks after our call, OpenAI incorporated search into ChatGPT,
                                            supplementing answers from its language model with information from across
                                            the web. If the model thinks a response would benefit from up-to-date
                                            information, it will automatically run a web search (OpenAI won’t say who
                                            its search partners are) and incorporate those responses into its answer,
                                            with links out if you want to learn more. You can also opt to manually force
                                            it to search the web if it does not do so on its own. OpenAI won’t reveal
                                            how many people are using its web search, but it says some 250 million
                                            people use ChatGPT weekly, all of whom are potentially exposed to it. </p>

                                        <p>According to Fishkin, these newer forms of AI-assisted search aren’t yet
                                            challenging Google’s search dominance. “It does not appear to be
                                            cannibalizing classic forms of web search,” he says. </p>
                                        <p>OpenAI insists it’s not really trying to compete on search—although frankly
                                            this seems to me like a bit of expectation setting. Rather, it says, web
                                            search is mostly a means to get more current information than the data in
                                            its training models, which tend to have specific cutoff dates that are often
                                            months, or even a year or more, in the past. As a result, while ChatGPT may
                                            be great at explaining how a West Coast offense works, it has long been
                                            useless at telling you what the latest 49ers score is. No more. </p>
                                        <p>“I come at it from the perspective of ‘How can we make ChatGPT able to answer
                                            every question that you have? How can we make it more useful to you on a
                                            daily basis?’ And that’s where search comes in for us,” Kevin Weil, the
                                            chief product officer with OpenAI, tells me. “There’s an incredible amount

                                        <p>Today ChatGPT is able to generate responses for very current news events, as
                                            well as near-real-time information on things like stock prices. And while
                                            ChatGPT’s interface has long been, well, boring, search results bring in all
                                            sorts of multimedia—images, graphs, even video. It’s a very different
                                            experience. </p>
                                        <p>Weil also argues that ChatGPT has more freedom to innovate and go its own way
                                            than competitors like Google—even more than its partner Microsoft does with
                                            Bing. Both of those are ad-dependent businesses. OpenAI is not. (At least
                                            not yet.) It earns revenue from the developers, businesses, and individuals
                                            who use it directly. It’s mostly setting large amounts of money on fire
                                            right now—it’s projected to lose $14 billion in 2026, by some reports. But
                                            one thing it doesn’t have to worry about is putting ads in its search
                                            results as Google does. </p>

                                        <p>Like Google, ChatGPT is pulling in information from web publishers,
                                            summarizing it, and including it in its answers. But it has also struck
                                            financial deals with publishers, a payment for providing the information
                                            that gets rolled into its results. (<em>MIT Technology Review</em> has been
                                            in discussions with OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, and others about publisher
                                            deals but has not entered into any agreements. Editorial was neither party
                                            to nor informed about the content of those discussions.)</p>
                                        <p>But the thing is, for web search to accomplish what OpenAI wants—to be more
                                            current than the language model—it also has to bring in information from all
                                            sorts of publishers and sources that it <em>doesn’t </em>have deals with.
                                            OpenAI’s head of media partnerships, Varun Shetty, told <em>MIT Technology
                                                Review</em> that it won’t give preferential treatment to its publishing
                                            partners.</p>
                                        <p>Instead, OpenAI told me, the model itself finds the most trustworthy and
                                            useful source for any given question. And that can get weird too. In that
                                            very first example it showed me—when Turley ran that name search—it
                                            described a story I wrote years ago for <em>Wired</em> about being hacked.
                                            That story remains one of the most widely read I’ve ever written. But
                                            ChatGPT didn’t link to it. It linked to a short rewrite from <em>The
                                                Verge</em>. Admittedly, this was on a prototype version of search, which
                                            was, as Turley said, “risky.” </p>
                                        <p>When I asked him about it, he couldn’t really explain <em>why</em> the model
                                            chose the sources that it did, because the model itself makes that
                                            evaluation. The company helps steer it by identifying—sometimes with the
                                            help of users—what it considers better answers, but the model actually
                                            selects them. </p>
                                        <p>“And in many cases, it gets it wrong, which is why we have work to do,” said
                                            Turley. “Having a model in the loop is a very, very different mechanism than
                                            how a search engine worked in the past.”</p>
                                        <p>Indeed! </p>

                                        <p>The model, whether it’s OpenAI’s GPT-4o or Google’s Gemini or Anthropic’s
                                            Claude, can be very, very good at explaining things. But the rationale
                                            behind its explanations, its reasons for selecting a particular source, and
                                            even the language it may use in an answer are all pretty mysterious. Sure, a
                                            model can explain very many things, but not when that comes to its own
                                            answers. </p>

                                        <p>It was almost a decade ago, in 2016, when Pichai wrote that Google was moving
                                            from “mobile first” to “AI first”: “But in the next 10 years, we will shift
                                            to a world that is AI-first, a world where computing becomes universally
                                            available—be it at home, at work, in the car, or on the go—and interacting
                                            with all of these surfaces becomes much more natural and intuitive, and
                                            above all, more intelligent.” </p>
                                        <p>We’re there now—sort of. And it’s a weird place to be. It’s going to get
                                            weirder. That’s especially true as these things we now think of as
                                            distinct—querying a search engine, prompting a model, looking for a photo
                                            we’ve taken, deciding what we want to read or watch or hear, asking for a
                                            photo we wish we’d taken, and didn’t, but would still like to see—begin to
                                            merge. </p>

                                        <p>The search results we see from generative AI are best understood as a
                                            waypoint rather than a destination. What’s most important may not be search
                                            in itself; rather, it’s that search has given AI model developers a path to
                                            incorporating real-time information into their inputs and outputs. And that
                                            opens up all sorts of possibilities.</p>
                                        <p>“A ChatGPT that can understand and access the web won’t just be about
                                            summarizing results. It might be about doing things for you. And I think
                                            there’s a fairly exciting future there,” says OpenAI’s Weil. “You can
                                            imagine having the model book you a flight, or order DoorDash, or just
                                            accomplish general tasks for you in the future. It’s just once the model
                                            understands how to use the internet, the sky’s the limit.”</p>
                                        <p>This is the agentic future we’ve been hearing about for some time now, and
                                            the more AI models make use of real-time data from the internet, the closer
                                            it gets. </p>
                                        <p>Let’s say you have a trip coming up in a few weeks. An agent that can get
                                            data from the internet in real time can book your flights and hotel rooms,
                                            make dinner reservations, and more, based on what it knows about you and
                                            your upcoming travel—all without your having to guide it. Another agent
                                            could, say, monitor the sewage output of your home for certain diseases, and
                                            order tests and treatments in response. You won’t <em>have</em> to search
                                            for that weird noise your car is making, because the agent in your vehicle
                                            will already have done it and made an appointment to get the issue fixed.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>“It’s not always going to be just doing search and giving answers,” says
                                            Pichai. “Sometimes it’s going to be actions. Sometimes you’ll be interacting
                                            within the real world. So there is a notion of universal assistance through
                                            it all.”</p>

                                        <p>And the ways these things will be able to deliver answers is evolving rapidly
                                            now too. For example, today Google can not only search text, images, and
                                            even video; it can create them. Imagine overlaying that ability with search
                                            across an array of formats and devices. “Show me what a Townsend’s warbler
                                            looks like in the tree in front of me.” Or “Use my existing family photos
                                            and videos to create a movie trailer of our upcoming vacation to Puerto Rico
                                            next year, making sure we visit all the best restaurants and top landmarks.”
                                        </p>
                                        <p>“We have primarily done it on the input side,” he says, referring to the ways
                                            Google can now search for an image or within a video. “But you can imagine
                                            it on the output side too.”</p>
                                        <p>This is the kind of future Pichai says he is excited to bring online. Google
                                            has already showed off a bit of what that might look like with NotebookLM, a
                                            tool that lets you upload large amounts of text and have it converted into a
                                            chatty podcast. He imagines this type of functionality—the ability to take
                                            one type of input and convert it into a variety of outputs—transforming the
                                            way we interact with information. </p>
                                        <p>In a demonstration of a tool called Project Astra this summer at its
                                            developer conference, Google showed one version of this outcome, where
                                            cameras and microphones in phones and smart glasses understand the context
                                            all around you—online and off, audible and visual—and have the ability to
                                            recall and respond in a variety of ways. Astra can, for example, look at a
                                            crude drawing of a Formula One race car and not only identify it, but also
                                            explain its various parts and their uses. </p>
                                        <p>But you can imagine things going a bit further (and they will). Let’s say I
                                            want to see a video of how to fix something on my bike. The video doesn’t
                                            exist, but the information does. AI-assisted generative search could
                                            theoretically find that information somewhere online—in a user manual buried
                                            in a company’s website, for example—and create a video to show me exactly
                                            how to do what I want, just as it could explain that to me with words today.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>These are the kinds of things that start to happen when you put the entire
                                            compendium of human knowledge—knowledge that’s previously been captured in
                                            silos of language and format; maps and business registrations and product
                                            SKUs; audio and video and databases of numbers and old books and images and,
                                            really, anything ever published, ever tracked, ever recorded; things
                                            happening right now, everywhere—and introduce a model into all that. A model
                                            that maybe can’t understand, precisely, but has the ability to put that
                                            information together, rearrange it, and spit it back in a variety of
                                            different hopefully helpful ways. Ways that a mere index could not.</p>
                                        <p>That’s what we’re on the cusp of, and what we’re starting to see. And as
                                            Google rolls this out to a billion people, many of whom will be interacting
                                            with a conversational AI for the first time, what will that mean? What will
                                            we do differently? It’s all changing so quickly. Hang on, just hang on.
