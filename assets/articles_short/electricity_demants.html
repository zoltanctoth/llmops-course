            <p>Electricity demand rose by 4.3% in 2024 and will continue to
                grow at close to 4% annually through 2027, according to <a

            <p>If that sounds familiar, it may be because there’s been a
                constant stream of headlines about energy demand recently,
                largely because of the influx of data centers—especially
                those needed to power the AI that’s spreading seemingly
                everywhere. These technologies are sucking up more power
                from the grid, but they’re just a small part of a much
                larger story. </p>
            <p>What’s actually behind this demand growth is complicated.
                Much of the increase comes from China, India, and Southeast
                Asia. Air-conditioning, electric vehicles, and factories all
                play a role. And of course, we can’t entirely discount the
                data centers. Here are a few key things to know about global
                electricity in 2025, and where things are going next.</p>

            <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>China, India, and Southeast
                    Asia are the ones to watch.</strong></h3>
            <p>Between now and 2027, about 85% of electricity demand growth
                is expected to come from developing and emerging economies.
                China is an especially major force, having accounted for
                over half of global electricity demand growth last year.</p>
            <p>The influence of even individual sectors in China is
                staggering. For example, in 2024, about 300 terawatt-hours’
                worth of electricity was used <em>just to produce solar
                    modules, batteries, and electric vehicles</em>. That’s
                as much electricity as Italy uses in a year. And this sector
                is growing quickly. </p>
