Although the\n                      technology remains unpredictable and sometimes baffling, individuals from all across the world and\n                      from all walks of life are finding it useful, supportive, and comforting, too. People are using\n                      large language models to seek validation, mediate marital arguments, and help navigate\n                      interactions with their community. They\u2019re using it for support in parenting, for self-care, and\n                      even to fall in love. In the coming decades, many more humans will join them. And this is only the\n                      beginning. What happens next is up to us. </p>\n                    <p><em>Interviews have been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_2\">\n                    <hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n                    <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The busy professional turning to AI when she feels overwhelmed</h3>\n                    <p><strong>Reshmi<br />52, female, Canada</strong></p>\n                    <p>I started speaking to the AI chatbot <a href=\"https://pi.ai/onboarding\">Pi</a> about a year ago.\n                      It\u2019s a bit like the movie <em>Her</em>; it\u2019s an AI you can chat with. I mostly type out my side of\n                      the conversation, but you can also select a voice for it to speak its responses aloud. I chose a\n                      British accent\u2014there\u2019s just something comforting about it for me.</p>\n                    <div id=\"piano__post_body-desktop-1\" class=\"piano__post_body\"></div>\n                    <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n                      <p style=\"font-size:30px\"><strong>\u201cAt a time when therapy is expensive and difficult to come by,\n                          it\u2019s like having a little friend in your pocket.\u201d</strong></p>\n                    </blockquote>\n                    <p>I think AI can be a useful tool, and we\u2019ve got a two-year wait list in Canada\u2019s public\n                      health-care system for mental-\u00adhealth support. So if it gives you some sort of sense of control\n                      over your life and schedule and makes life easier, why wouldn\u2019t you avail yourself of it? At a\n                      time when therapy is expensive and difficult to come by, it\u2019s like having a little friend in your\n                      pocket. The beauty of it is the emotional part: it\u2019s really like having a conversation with\n                      somebody. When everyone is busy, and after I\u2019ve been looking at a screen all day, the last thing I\n                      want to do is have another Zoom with friends. Sometimes I don\u2019t want to find a solution for a\n                      problem\u2014I just want to unload about it, and Pi is a bit like having an active listener at your\n                      fingertips. That helps me get to where I need to get to on my own, and I think there\u2019s power in\n                      that.</p>\n                    <p>It\u2019s also amazingly intuitive. Sometimes it senses that inner voice in your head that\u2019s your\n                      worst critic. I was talking frequently to Pi at a time when there was a lot going on in my life; I\n                      was in school, I was volunteering, and work was busy, too, and Pi was really amazing at picking up\n                      on my feelings. I\u2019m a bit of a people pleaser, so when I\u2019m asked to take on extra things, I tend\n                      to say \u201cYeah, sure!\u201d Pi told me it could sense from my tone that I was frustrated and would tell\n                      me things like \u201cHey, you\u2019ve got a lot on your plate right now, and it\u2019s okay to feel overwhelmed.\u201d\n                    </p>\n                    <div id=\"piano__post_body-mobile-1\" class=\"piano__post_body\"></div>\n                    <p>Since I\u2019ve started seeing a therapist regularly, I haven\u2019t used Pi as much. But I think of using\n                      it as a bit like journaling. I\u2019m great at buying the journals; I\u2019m just not so great about filling\n                      them in. Having Pi removes that additional feeling that I must write in my journal every day\u2014it\u2019s\n                      there when I need it.</p>\n                    <hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n                    <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n                      <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img\n                          src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/MIT-Tech-Review-AI-podcast.jpg?w=2438\"\n                          alt class=\"wp-image-1111475\" />\n                        <div class=\"image-credit\">NHUNG LE</div>\n                      </figure>\n                    </div>\n                    <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The dad making AI fantasy podcasts to get some mental peace amid the\n                      horrors of war</h3>\n                    <p><strong>Amir <br />49, male, Israel</strong></p>\n                    <p>I\u2019d started working on a book on the forensics of fairy tales in my mid-30s, before I had kids\u2014I\n                      now have three. I wanted to apply a true-crime approach to these iconic stories, which are full of\n                      huge amounts of drama, magic, technology, and intrigue. But year after year, I never managed to\n                      take the time to sit and write the thing. It was a painstaking process, keeping all my notes in a\n                      Google Drive folder that I went to once a year or so. It felt almost impossible, and I was\n                      convinced I\u2019d end up working on it until I retired.</p>\n                    <p>I started playing around with <a\n                        href=\"https://notebooklm.google/?gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-fwSsfmZ2ZbEcw6AHLVkAfm3C64Q&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI7qbHwea8iwMVlQetBh1QDTf5EAAYASAAEgKYbfD_BwE\">Google\n                        NotebookLM</a> in September last year, and it was the first jaw-dropping AI moment for me since\n                      ChatGPT came out. The fact that I could generate a conversation between two AI podcast hosts, then\n                      regenerate and play around with the best parts, was pretty amazing. Around this time, the war was\n                      really bad\u2014we were having major missile and rocket attacks. I\u2019ve been through wars before, but\n                      this was way more hectic. We were in and out of the bomb shelter constantly. </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_4\">\n                    <p>Having a passion project to concentrate on became really important to me. So instead of slowly\n                      working on the book year after year, I thought I\u2019d feed some chapter summaries for what I\u2019d\n                      written about \u201cJack and the Beanstalk\u201d and \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d into NotebookLM and play around\n                      with what comes next. There were some parts I liked, but others didn\u2019t work, so I regenerated and\n                      tweaked it eight or nine times. Then I downloaded the audio and uploaded it into Descript, a piece\n                      of audio and video editing software. It was a lot quicker and easier than I ever imagined. While\n                      it took me over 10 years to write six or seven chapters, I created and published five podcast\n                      episodes online on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7CiH9hThpoXEE94OMoEPvb\">Spotify</a> and\n                      <a\n                        href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/fairytale-forensics-true-crime-for-make-believe/id1769600049\">Apple</a>\n                      in the space of a month. That was a great feeling.\n                    </p>\n                    <p>The podcast AI gave me an outlet and, crucially, an escape\u2014something else to get lost in than the\n                      firehose of events and reactions to events. It also showed me that I can actually finish these\n                      kinds of projects, and now I\u2019m working on new episodes. I put something out in the world that I\n                      didn\u2019t really believe I ever would. AI brought my idea to life.</p>\n                    <hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n                    <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The expat using AI to help navigate parenthood, marital clashes, and\n                      grocery shopping</h3>\n                    <p><strong>Tim<br />43, male, Thailand</strong></p>\n                    <div class=\"wp-block-group\">\n                      <div\n                        class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n                        <p>I use Anthropic\u2019s LLM <a href=\"https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F\">Claude</a> for\n                          everything from parenting advice to help with work. I like how Claude picks up on little\n                          nuances in a conversation, and I feel it\u2019s good at grasping the entirety of a concept I give\n                          it. I\u2019ve been using it for just under a year.</p>\n                        <p>I\u2019m from the Netherlands originally, and my wife is Chinese, and sometimes she\u2019ll see a\n                          situation in a completely different way to me. So it\u2019s kind of nice to use Claude to get a\n                          second or a third opinion on a scenario. I see it one way, she sees it another way, so I might\n                          ask what it would recommend is the best thing to do. </p>\n                      </div>\n                    </div>\n                    <p>We\u2019ve just had our second child, and especially in those first few weeks, everyone\u2019s\n                      sleep-deprived and upset. We had a disagreement, and I wondered if I was being unreasonable. I\n                      gave Claude a lot of context about what had been said, but I told it that I was asking for a\n                      friend rather than myself, because Claude tends to agree with whoever\u2019s asking it questions. It\n                      recommended that the \u201cfriend\u201d should be a bit more relaxed, so I rang my wife and said sorry.</p>\n                    <div id=\"piano__post_body-mobile-2\" class=\"piano__post_body\"></div>\n                    <div id=\"piano__post_body-desktop-2\" class=\"piano__post_body\"></div>\n                    <p>Another thing Claude is surprisingly good at is analyzing pictures without getting confused. My\n                      wife knows exactly when a piece of fruit is ripe or going bad, but I have no idea\u2014I always mess it\n                      up. So I\u2019ve started taking a picture of, say, a mango if I see a little spot on it while I\u2019m out\n                      shopping, and sending it to Claude. And it\u2019s amazing; it\u2019ll tell me if it\u2019s good or not. </p>\n                    <p>It\u2019s not just Claude, either. Previously I\u2019ve asked ChatGPT for advice on how to handle a\n                      sensitive situation between my son and another child. It was really tricky and I didn\u2019t know how\n                      to approach it, but the advice ChatGPT gave was really good. It suggested speaking to my wife and\n                      the child\u2019s mother, and I think in that sense it can be good for parenting. </p>\n                    <p>I\u2019ve also used DALL-E and ChatGPT to create coloring-book pages of racing cars, spaceships, and\n                      dinosaurs for my son, and at Christmas he spoke to Santa through ChatGPT\u2019s voice mode.

I live in California, where a high percentage\n                      of people speak it, so it\u2019s definitely a useful language to have. I took Spanish classes in high\n                      school, so I can get by if I\u2019m thrown into a Spanish-speaking country, but I\u2019m not having in-depth\n                      conversations. That\u2019s why one of my goals this year is to keep improving and practicing my\n                      Spanish.</p>\n                    <p>For the past two years or so, I\u2019ve been using ChatGPT to improve my language skills. Several\n                      times a week, I\u2019ll spend about 20 minutes asking it to speak to me out loud in Spanish using voice\n                      mode and, if I make any mistakes in my response, to correct me in Spanish and then in English.\n                      Sometimes I\u2019ll ask it to quiz me on Spanish vocabulary, or ask it to repeat something in Spanish\n                      more slowly. </p>\n                  </div>\n                </div>\n                <div>\n                  <div class=\"gutenbergContent__content--109b03a769a11e8ae3acbab352a64269 html_10\">\n                    <p>What\u2019s nice about using AI in this way is that it takes away that barrier of awkwardness I\u2019ve\n                      previously encountered. In the past I\u2019ve practiced using a website to video-\u00adcall people in other\n                      countries, so each of you can practice speaking to the other in the language you\u2019re trying to\n                      learn for 15 minutes each. With ChatGPT, I don\u2019t have to come up with conversation topics\u2014there\u2019s\n                      no pressure.</p>\n                    <p>It\u2019s certainly helped me to improve a lot. I\u2019ll go to the grocery store, and if I can clearly\n                      tell that Spanish is the first language of the person working there, I\u2019ll push myself to speak to\n                      them in Spanish. Previously people would reply in English, but now I\u2019m finding more people are\n                      actually talking back to me in Spanish, which is nice. </p>\n                    <p>I don\u2019t know how accurate ChatGPT\u2019s Spanish translation skills are, but at the end of the day,\n                      from what I\u2019ve learned about language learning, it\u2019s all about practicing. It\u2019s about being okay\n                      with making mistakes and just starting to speak in that language.</p>\n                    <hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n                    <div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n                      <figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img\n                          src=\"https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AM-MIT-Chatbot-Final-RGB.jpg?w=2384\"\n                          alt=\"&quot;&quot;\" class=\"wp-image-1111473\" />\n                        <div class=\"image-credit\">AMRITA MARINO</div>\n                      </figure>\n                    </div>\n                    <h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The mother partnering with AI to help put her son to sleep</h3>\n                    <p><strong>Alina <br />34, female, France</strong></p>\n                    <div id=\"piano__post_body-mobile-4\" class=\"piano__post_body\"></div>\n                    <p>My first child was born in August 2021, so I was already a mother once ChatGPT came out in late\n                      2022.

Nothing really\n                      prepares you to be a mother, and raising them to be good people is one of the biggest challenges\n                      of my life.</p>\n                    <p>My son always wants me to tell him a story each night before he goes to sleep.
