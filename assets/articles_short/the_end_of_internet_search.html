            <p>We all know what it means, colloquially, to google something. You pop a few
                relevant words in a search box and in return get a list of blue links to the
                most relevant results. Maybe some quick explanations up top. Maybe some maps
                or sports scores or a video. But fundamentally, it’s just fetching
                information that’s already out there on the internet and showing it to you,
                in some sort of structured way. </p>
            <p>But all that is up for grabs. We are at a new inflection point.</p>

            <p>The biggest change to the way search engines have delivered information to us
                since the 1990s is happening right now. No more keyword searching. No more
                sorting through links to click. Instead, we’re entering an era of
                conversational search. Which means instead of keywords, you use real
                questions, expressed in natural language. And instead of links, you’ll
                increasingly be met with answers, written by generative AI and based on live
                information from all across the internet, delivered the same way. </p>
            <p>Of course, Google—the company that has defined search for the past 25
                years—is trying to be out front on this. In May of 2023, it began testing
                AI-generated responses to search queries, using its large language model
                (LLM) to deliver the kinds of answers you might expect from an expert source
                or trusted friend. It calls these AI Overviews. Google CEO Sundar Pichai
                described this to <em>MIT Technology Review</em> as “one of the most
                positive changes we’ve done to search in a long, long time.”</p>
            <div id="piano__post_body-desktop-1" class="piano__post_body"></div>
            <p>AI Overviews fundamentally change the kinds of queries Google can address.
                You can now ask it things like “I’m going to Japan for one week next month.
                I’ll be staying in Tokyo but would like to take some day trips. Are there
                any festivals happening nearby? How will the surfing be in Kamakura? Are
                there any good bands playing?” And you’ll get an answer—not just a link to
                Reddit, but a built-out answer with current results. </p>
            <p>More to the point, you can attempt searches that were once pretty much
                impossible, and get the right answer. You don’t have to be able to
                articulate what, precisely, you are looking for. You can describe what the
                bird in your yard looks like, or what the issue seems to be with your
                refrigerator, or that weird noise your car is making, and get an almost
                human explanation put together from sources previously siloed across the
                internet. It’s amazing, and once you start searching that way, it’s
                addictive.</p>
