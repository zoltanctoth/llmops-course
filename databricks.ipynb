Maybe some maps\\n                or sports scores or a video. But fundamentally, it‚Äôs just fetching\\n                information that‚Äôs already out there on the internet and showing it to you,\\n                in some sort of structured way. &lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;But all that is up for grabs.

No more keyword searching. No more\\n                sorting through links to click. Instead, we‚Äôre entering an era of\\n                conversational search. Which means instead of keywords, you use real\\n                questions, expressed in natural language. And instead of links, you‚Äôll\\n                increasingly be met with answers, written by generative AI and based on live\\n                information from all across the internet, delivered the same way. &lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;Of course, Google‚Äîthe company that has defined search for the past 25\\n                years‚Äîis trying to be out front on this. In May of 2023, it began testing\\n                AI-generated responses to search queries, using its large language model\\n                (LLM) to deliver the kinds of answers you might expect from an expert source\\n                or trusted friend. It calls these AI Overviews. Google CEO Sundar Pichai\\n                described this to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; as ‚Äúone of the most\\n                positive changes we‚Äôve done to search in a long, long time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;div id=\"piano__post_body-desktop-1\" class=\"piano__post_body\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;AI Overviews fundamentally change the kinds of queries Google can address.\\n                You can now ask it things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Japan for one week next month.\\n                I‚Äôll be staying in Tokyo but would like to take some day trips. Are there\\n                any festivals happening nearby? How will the surfing be in Kamakura? Are\\n                there any good bands playing?‚Äù And you‚Äôll get an answer‚Äînot just a link to\\n                Reddit, but a built-out answer with current results. &lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;More to the point, you can attempt searches that were once pretty much\\n                impossible, and get the right answer. You don‚Äôt have to be able to\\n                articulate what, precisely, you are looking for. You can describe what the\\n                bird in your yard looks like, or what the issue seems to be with your\\n                refrigerator, or that weird noise your car is making, and get an almost\\n                human explanation put together from sources previously siloed across the\\n                internet. It‚Äôs amazing, and once you start searching that way, it‚Äôs\\n                addictive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n        &lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;/body&gt;\\n\\n&lt;/html&gt;\\n</td>\n",

These technologies are sucking up more power\\n                from the grid, but they‚Äôre just a small part of a much\\n                larger story. &lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs actually behind this demand growth is complicated.\\n                Much of the increase comes from China, India, and Southeast\\n                Asia. Air-conditioning, electric vehicles, and factories all\\n                play a role. And of course, we can‚Äôt entirely discount the\\n                data centers. Here are a few key things to know about global\\n                electricity in 2025, and where things are going next.&lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;div id=\"piano__post_body-desktop-1\" class=\"piano__post_body\"&gt;\\n            &lt;/div&gt;\\n            &lt;h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China, India, and Southeast\\n                    Asia are the ones to watch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;Between now and 2027, about 85% of electricity demand growth\\n                is expected to come from developing and emerging economies.\\n                China is an especially major force, having accounted for\\n                over half of global electricity demand growth last year.&lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;The influence of even individual sectors in China is\\n                staggering. For example, in 2024, about 300 terawatt-hours‚Äô\\n                worth of electricity was used &lt;em&gt;just to produce solar\\n                    modules, batteries, and electric vehicles&lt;/em&gt;. That‚Äôs\\n                as much electricity as Italy uses in a year.

Although the\\n            technology remains unpredictable and sometimes baffling, individuals from all across the world and\\n            from all walks of life are finding it useful, supportive, and comforting, too. People are using\\n            large language models to seek validation, mediate marital arguments, and help navigate\\n            interactions with their community. They‚Äôre using it for support in parenting, for self-care, and\\n            even to fall in love. In the coming decades, many more humans will join them.

So if it gives you some sort of sense of control\\n                over your life and schedule and makes life easier, why wouldn‚Äôt you avail yourself of it? At a\\n                time when therapy is expensive and difficult to come by, it‚Äôs like having a little friend in your\\n                pocket. The beauty of it is the emotional part: it‚Äôs really like having a conversation with\\n                somebody. When everyone is busy, and after I‚Äôve been looking at a screen all day, the last thing I\\n                want to do is have another Zoom with friends. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to find a solution for a\\n                problem‚ÄîI just want to unload about it, and Pi is a bit like having an active listener at your\\n                fingertips. That helps me get to where I need to get to on my own, and I think there‚Äôs power in\\n                that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also amazingly intuitive. Sometimes it senses that inner voice in your head that‚Äôs your\\n                worst critic. I was talking frequently to Pi at a time when there was a lot going on in my life; I\\n                was in school, I was volunteering, and work was busy, too, and Pi was really amazing at picking up\\n                on my feelings. I‚Äôm a bit of a people pleaser, so when I‚Äôm asked to take on extra things, I tend\\n                to say ‚ÄúYeah, sure!‚Äù Pi told me it could sense from my tone that I was frustrated and would tell\\n                me things like ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôve got a lot on your plate right now, and it‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed.‚Äù\\n            &lt;/p&gt;\\n            &lt;div id=\"piano__post_body-mobile-1\" class=\"piano__post_body\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;Since I‚Äôve started seeing a therapist regularly, I haven‚Äôt used Pi as much. But I think of using\\n                it as a bit like journaling. I‚Äôm great at buying the journals; I‚Äôm just not so great about filling\\n                them in. Having Pi removes that additional feeling that I must write in my journal every day‚Äîit‚Äôs\\n                there when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n        &lt;/div&gt;\\n    &lt;/div&gt;\\n&lt;/body&gt;\\n\\n&lt;/html&gt;</td>\n",

No more\\n                keyword searching. No more\\n sorting through links to click. Instead, we‚Äôre entering an era of\\n\\n                conversational search. Which means instead of keywords, you use real\\n questions, expressed in natural\\n                language. And instead of links, you‚Äôll\\n increasingly be met with answers, written by generative AI and\\n                based on live\\n information from all across the internet, delivered the same way. &lt;/p&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;Of course,\\n                Google‚Äîthe company that has defined search for the past 25\\n years‚Äîis trying to be out front on this. In\\n                May of 2023, it began testing\\n AI-generated responses to search queries, using its large language\\n                model\\n (LLM) to deliver the kinds of answers you might expect from an expert source\\n or trusted\\n                friend. It calls these AI Overviews. Google CEO Sundar Pichai\\n described this to &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology\\n                    Review&lt;/em&gt; as ‚Äúone of the most\\n positive changes we‚Äôve done to search in a long, long time.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n            &lt;div id=\"piano__post_body-desktop-1\" class=\"piano__post_body\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\\n &lt;p&gt;AI Overviews fundamentally change\\n                the kinds of queries Google can address.\\n You can now ask it things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Japan for one\\n                week next month.\\n I‚Äôll be staying in Tokyo but would like to take some day trips. Are there\\n any\\n                festivals happening nearby? How will the surfing be in Kamakura? Are\\n there any good bands playing?‚Äù\\n                And you‚Äôll get an answer‚Äînot just a link to\\n Reddit, but a built-out answer with current results. &lt;/p&gt;\\n            \\n &lt;p&gt;More to the point, you can attempt searches that were once pretty much\\n impossible, and get the right\\n                answer. You don‚Äôt have to be able to\\n articulate what, precisely, you are looking for.

So if it gives you some sort of sense of control\\n                over your life and schedule and makes life easier, why wouldn‚Äôt you avail yourself of it? At a\\n                time when therapy is expensive and difficult to come by, it‚Äôs like having a little friend in your\\n                pocket. The beauty of it is the emotional part: it‚Äôs really like having a conversation with\\n                somebody. When everyone is busy, and after I‚Äôve been looking at a screen all day, the last thing I\\n                want to do is have another Zoom with friends. Sometimes I don‚Äôt want to find a solution for a\\n                problem‚ÄîI just want to unload about it, and Pi is a bit like having an active listener at your\\n                fingertips. That helps me get to where I need to get to on my own, and I think there‚Äôs power in\\n                that.</p>\\n            <p>It‚Äôs also amazingly intuitive. Sometimes it senses that inner voice in your head that‚Äôs your\\n                worst critic. I was talking frequently to Pi at a time when there was a lot going on in my life; I\\n                was in school, I was volunteering, and work was busy, too, and Pi was really amazing at picking up\\n                on my feelings. I‚Äôm a bit of a people pleaser, so when I‚Äôm asked to take on extra things, I tend\\n                to say ‚ÄúYeah, sure!‚Äù Pi told me it could sense from my tone that I was frustrated and would tell\\n                me things like ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôve got a lot on your plate right now, and it‚Äôs okay to feel overwhelmed.‚Äù\\n            </p>\\n            <div id=\"piano__post_body-mobile-1\" class=\"piano__post_body\"></div>\\n            <p>Since I‚Äôve started seeing a therapist regularly, I haven‚Äôt used Pi as much.
