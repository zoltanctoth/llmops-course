                                        <p>If that sounds familiar, it may be because there’s been a
                                            constant stream of headlines about energy demand recently,
                                            largely because of the influx of data centers—especially
                                            those needed to power the AI that’s spreading seemingly
                                            everywhere. These technologies are sucking up more power
                                            from the grid, but they’re just a small part of a much
                                            larger story. </p>
                                        <p>What’s actually behind this demand growth is complicated.
                                            Much of the increase comes from China, India, and Southeast
                                            Asia. Air-conditioning, electric vehicles, and factories all
                                            play a role. And of course, we can’t entirely discount the
                                            data centers. Here are a few key things to know about global
                                            electricity in 2025, and where things are going next.</p>
                                        <div id="piano__post_body-desktop-1" class="piano__post_body">
                                        </div>
                                        <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>China, India, and Southeast
                                                Asia are the ones to watch.</strong></h3>
                                        <p>Between now and 2027, about 85% of electricity demand growth
                                            is expected to come from developing and emerging economies.
                                            China is an especially major force, having accounted for
                                            over half of global electricity demand growth last year.</p>
                                        <p>The influence of even individual sectors in China is
                                            staggering. For example, in 2024, about 300 terawatt-hours’
                                            worth of electricity was used <em>just to produce solar
                                                modules, batteries, and electric vehicles</em>. That’s
                                            as much electricity as Italy uses in a year. And this sector
                                            is growing quickly. </p>

                                        <p>A boom in heavy industry, an increase in the number of air
                                            conditioners, and a robust electric-vehicle market are all
                                            adding to China’s power demand. India and Southeast Asia are
                                            also going to have above-average increases in demand, driven
                                            by economic growth and increased adoption of air
                                            conditioners. </p>
                                        <p>And there’s a lot of growth yet to come, as 600 million
                                            people across Africa still don’t have access to reliable
                                            electricity.</p>
                                        <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Data centers are a somewhat
                                                minor factor globally, but they can’t be counted

                                            last year, data centers are expected to account for less
                                            than 10% of global electricity demand growth between now and
                                            2030. That’s less than the expected growth due to other
                                            contributors like electric vehicles, air conditioners, and
                                            heavy industry.</p>

                                            electricity demand for the last 15 years, in part because of
                                            efficiency improvements. Data centers are reversing that

                                        <p>Take the US, for example. The IEA report points to other
                                            research showing that the 10 states hosting the most data
                                            center growth saw a 10% increase in electricity demand
                                            between 2019 and 2023. Demand in the other 40 states
                                            declined by about 3% over the same period.</p>
                                        <p>One caveat here is that nobody knows for sure what’s going to
                                            happen with data centers in the future, particularly those
                                            needed to run AI. Projections are all over the place, and
                                            small changes could drastically alter the amount of energy
                                            required for the technology. (<a

                                            demand in the future, with demand projected to double
                                            between now and 2027 (though, again, it’s all quite
                                            uncertain).</p>

                                        <p>Growth in electricity demand can be seen as a good thing for
                                            our climate. Using a heat pump rather than a natural-gas
                                            heating system can help reduce emissions even as it
                                            increases electricity use. But as we add demand to the grid,
                                            it’s important to remember that in many places, it’s still

                                        <p>The good news in all this is that there’s enough expansion in
                                            renewable and low-emissions electricity sources to cover the
                                            growth in demand. The rapid deployment of solar power alone
                                            contributes enough energy to cover half the demand growth
                                            expected through 2027. Nuclear power is also expected to see
                                            new heights soon, with recovery in France, restarts in
                                            Japan, and new reactors in China and India adding to a
                                            stronger global industry.</p>
                                        <p>However, just adding renewables to meet electricity demand
                                            doesn’t automatically pull fossil fuels off the grid;
                                            existing coal and natural-gas plants are still chugging
                                            along all over the world. To make a dent in emissions,
                                            low-carbon sources need to grow fast enough not only to meet
                                            new demand, but to replace existing dirtier sources.</p>
                                        <p>It isn’t inherently bad that the grid is growing. More people
                                            having air-conditioning and more factories making solar
                                            panels are all firmly in the “positive” column, I’d argue.
                                            But keeping up with this breakneck pace of demand growth is
                                            going to be a challenge—one that could have major effects on
                                            our ability to cut emissions. </p>
